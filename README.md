<!-- ANCHOR: introduction -->

_slom_ is a command-line tool designed for managing [service level objective](https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/) (SLO) specifications.
This tool enables you to:

- **Record service level indicator (SLI)** metrics using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- **Trigger alerts** based on SLOs and error budgets using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- **Generate SLO documentation**

Unlike existing tools for SLOs, slom emphasizes the ability to **finely tune SLIs and SLO alerts** for large-scale systems and experienced administrators.
